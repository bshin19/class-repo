## What is a Javascript Linter
+ A linter is a tool that we can use to analyze our code for potential errors as we're writing it.
  * Linters can also be used to enforce particular styles of coding based on rules we can turn on or off.
  
+ Linters are useful because they can help teams write more consistent and readable code according to what they consider to be best practices.
  * They're also helpful for identifying potential errors before the code is even run, thus improving overall code quality.
