## State

## Component Lifecycle
+ Is the pattern of initial mounting and unmounting of components
+

## State Styles
+ A stateful component doesn't change like other components. It's a parent of components w/ states.
+ No Coupling: A component isn't required to have a parent that passes elements to its children.
  + *Best practice is to avoid coupling behavior*

## builtin React commands for lifecycle used today
  
> componentDidMount() { //after mounting, perform whatever function/commands follow

> render() { //renders

+ Turnary operators are essentially if/else statements but is an expression instead of a statement, making it usable in a return.

{this.state.xxxx.xxxx ? ( ...statement1... ) : ( ... else...)
