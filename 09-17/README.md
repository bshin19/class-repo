## State

## Component Lifecycle
+ Is the pattern of initial mounting and unmounting of components
+

## State Styles
+ A stateful component doesn't change like other components. It's a parent of components w/ states.
+ No Coupling: A component isn't required to have a parent that passes elements to its children.
  + *Best practice is to avoid coupling behavior*

## builtin React commands for lifecycle used today
  
> componentDidMount() { //after mounting, perform whatever function/commands follow

> render() { //renders

+ Turnary operators are essentially if/else statements but is an expression instead of a statement, making it usable in a return.

{this.state.xxxx.xxxx ? ( ...statement1... ) : ( ... else...)

+ yarn add react-router-dom

## ArrayList vs HashMap vs Set

#### Set
Sets contain no duplicate elements
All constructors must create a set that has no duplicate elements

#### HashMap
unsynchronized and permits nulls
When a HashMap's data cap is reached, it rehashes and doubles in size
Like a JS object in a way
Doesn't allow for duplicate keys but allows for duplicate values
Hashmap keeps track of association when adding
key and value must be removed to clear

#### ArrayList
Elements can be duplicates
adding adds to last
