# Algorithm

## What is an Algorithm?
A set of instructions / recipe
+ How do you determine if one algorithm is better than another?
  * Speed

* Linear Search is a synchronous search


## Benchmarking
The practice of testing how long an algorithm takes to code.

## Big O Notation
Time complexity is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

Space complexity is a function describing the amount of memory an algorith mtakes in terms of the amount of iinput to the algorithm.

## Pop quiz:
+ Define Algorithm
  * A recipe/instructions.
+ How might you choose objectively between two different algorithms
  * Benchmarks - time complexity
+ What is the time complexity for an algorithm that takes twice as long if you double the size of its input:
  * linear
+ Why is binary search so fast?
  * It halves options each time.
+ One essential difference between binary and linear search
  * Binary halves, linear goes linearly a-b-c
+ Why use binary?
  * Faster, sortable
+ Why use linear?
  * Unable to sort through data

## Side note
Quick Sort and binary searching are the fastest ways to search and sort respectively.
They both operate on the same premise by taking an element and then determining what is "above" and "below" that element in an array.
