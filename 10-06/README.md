# Data Structures

## Outline
+ Computer Science Context
+ Big O Notation

## Fundamentals
+ Isn't about "easy computer science stuff"
+ Rather, it's about the fundamental concepts that underlie all of the work we've been doing to date

### Books
+ Clean Code, Pragmatic Programmer (read first)
+ Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript, Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms

## Step
+ A step is an **instruction** to the computer
+ All computations boil down to a handful of "basic steps".
  * Arithmetic
  * Assignment
  * Boolean tests
  * Reading from memory
  * Writing to memory
+ Fewer steps means less work for the computer --ideal

## Efficiency
+ Time complexity is the rate which an algorithm slows as it grows.

## Big O Notation
+ Big O Notation allows us to describe how running time scales when we increase the input size
+ Denoted with a big O, and the "growth factor" in parentheses.
ex) head is O(1)
