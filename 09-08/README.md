# Riding with Mongoose

## Class Objectives:
+ Understand how to write up a mongoose schema to dictate rules for their mongoDB data.
+ create custom methods in Mongoose to set and update data purely on the back end
+ Mongoose's "populate" method to create relationships between the collections in their database.
+ Understanding why mySQL may still be more suitable for more complex projects.

## MySQL vs Mongo
+ In mysql, you can expect the db to do most of the work.
+ In Mongo, the dev has to do more of the legwork.
