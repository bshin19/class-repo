+ Access Modifiers
+ Subclasses
+ Abstract and Interface
+ Interface Case Study
+ Design Printable and DatabaseService Interface

## OOP
+ OOP is predicated on the idea that software systems should be decomposed into their constitutent units of functionality 
+ These units of functionality, which we might think of as modules, can then be used as building blocks to construct the sytem.
+ The idea is that this allows us to write better-organized code that is intrinsically easier to modify and maintain than other.

## Fields and Methods
+ Objects have cetrain values associated with them, which diffferentiate them from other objects of the same class.
+ Objects hae certain behaviors with them --methods-- which they have in common with other objects of the same class

+ **Fields** and **Methods** are new terms

## Polymorphism
+ Passing traits to 
> class subClassName extends ClassName

+ super takes a constructor from the parent and allows the child to use it
+ abstract means it will be used in a subclass.
